# cubecl_test
Just wanted to play around with gpu programming in Rust. Cubecl seemed pretty
cool, and it is pretty cool! Didn't have to write my kernel in wgls and easily
compiled with the wgpu backend. Couldn't compile with HIP backend for some
reason, maybe I'm missing some libraries. Will keep playing around with cubecl.
